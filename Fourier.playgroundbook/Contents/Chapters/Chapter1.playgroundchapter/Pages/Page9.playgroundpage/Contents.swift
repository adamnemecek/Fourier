 Above are two graphs showing the input and the output of a Fourier transform done on a complex tone generated by a piano at A 440Hz
 
 Notice that this complex tone is not only made up of a pure tone at 440 Hz but also at 880Hz, 1320Hzâ€¦
 
 (Typical Fourier transform plots use a logarithmic scale, but to show the equidistant relationship between component frequencies, a linear scale is being used here)
