 Here are a few sound waves with different fr equencies. Click on the play button to hear what they each sounds like.
 
 Notice how the pitch of those waves are different. In general, the higher the frequency, the higher the pitch.
 Now it's your turn! Create or modify sound waves using createWave(withFrequency:)
 
 Due to UI space limitations, you can only create 3 waves at a time. Also, it is helpful to note that the hearing range for humans is approximately from 20Hz to 20,000Hz
