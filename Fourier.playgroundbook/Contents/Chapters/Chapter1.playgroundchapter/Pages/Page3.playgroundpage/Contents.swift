/*:
 Notice how this wave repeats itself. The number of repetitions per second is called the wave's frequency.
 
 Frequencies are measured in Hz. A 10 Hz wave undergoes the same pattern of oscillation 10 times per second.
 
 The sound wave you just saw has a frequency 440Hz, meaning that it oscillates back and forth 440 times per second.
