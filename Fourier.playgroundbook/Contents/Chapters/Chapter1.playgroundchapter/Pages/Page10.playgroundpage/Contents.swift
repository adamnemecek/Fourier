/*:
 Why both the piano and the pure tone share the same pitch ('A4') is a topic for another time. If you are interested, a few good search keywords are: "pitch perception," "fundamental frequency," "harmonics," and "psychoacoustics."
 
 Hope you learned something new. You can now go back the music visualization or replay this mini lecture.
 
 Thanks to Joseph Fourier for making all of this possible.
