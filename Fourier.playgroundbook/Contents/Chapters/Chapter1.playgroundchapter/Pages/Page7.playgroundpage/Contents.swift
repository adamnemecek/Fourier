 Fourier transform is a mathematical tool that takes in time vs. displacement data and converts it to the different component frequencies that make up the data.
 
 The process is reversible, meaning that you can reconstruct the exact time vs. displacement graph using the out you got from the Fourier transform.
 
 Therefore, Fourier transform allows us to see what frequencies make up a complex tone without losing any information.
 
 Here's the equation of Fourier transform. For what it does, it is surprisingly short and elegant. You can marvel at its magnificence, but feel free to skip it once you've done so.
